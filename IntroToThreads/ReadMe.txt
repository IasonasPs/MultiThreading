(I) =>  
Declaration vs Definition in C# :
		I couldnt find a firm distinction between the 2 in C# , except that one:
		https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-the-difference-between-declaration-and-definition-in-Chash :
		Regarding variables -->
		Declaration means that variable is only declared and memory is allocated, but no value is set.
		Definition means the variable has been initialized.

		Regarding  Methods -->
		Declaration takes place in an Interface where we just "declare" the Signature of the method.
		Definition is where we "define" the actual implementation of the previously declared method.
